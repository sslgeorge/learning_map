#### _Facilitation Outcome 1 - Facilitating Soft Skills_

**Skill Description**

Soft Skills are one of the most critical components to delighting clients and accelerating your career. By introducing Andela Fellows to the relevant soft skills and the common client scenarios in which they are needed, you enable them to succeed in simulations, client placements, and even beyond and outside their work at Andela.

**Output**

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. A Facilitated session on one or more D1 level Soft Skills.
2. A feedback document and improvement plan for a Fellow struggling with a specific soft skill you introduced them to.

| The list of Andela-supported soft skills | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Common Fellow/client interaction scenarios in which each soft skill applies | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The 5 step sequence of the cognitive learning loop | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Strategies for inspiring/motivating Fellows to learn soft skills | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Strategies for supporting Fellows in adopting new behaviors | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Common cultural or environmental challenges Fellows face in behaving according to best practices in Soft Skills     | [ ] | [ ]  |

**Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When introducing Fellows to a specific soft skill for the first time.  |  |  |
| - **Action:** I describe the phrase Andela uses to refer to the soft skill, and I ask Fellows to volunteer the words they associate with the skill I've introduced. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| - **Action:** I host a discussion with Fellows about what might be gained through the use of the soft skill I'm introducing. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I check for understanding and inspiration before moving to the next stage of facilitation. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I believe Fellows are clear on the soft skill and its uses |  |     |
| - **Action:** I ask them to recall scenarios in which they used the skill before  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I ask them to describe which scenarios they imagine might arise during their Fellowship where this skill would apply  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When we have built a list of possible scenarios  |  |    |
| - **Action:** I invite Fellows to role play through the scenarios using what they believe about the skill being discussed. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I ask Fellows to support each other in brainstorming solutions.  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** After role-playing several scenarios with the Fellows  **Action:** I provide them with the soft skill's corresponding Learning Outcome.  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** Once the Fellows have each received their own copies of the Learning Outcomes  **Action:** I ask them to read through the LO and indicate the KBBs they believe they've understood or enacted and the ones they've observed in each other.  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** Once they've completed self-reporting and assessed each other  **Action:** I give them a few challenge scenarios and ask them to create responses to the scenarios using the KBBs in the Learning Outcome provided.  | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** Whenever I notice a Fellow struggling with adopting a new behavior related to a soft skill  **Action:** I give them some feedback and refer them to the specific behavior I'd like them to practice.  | [ ] |    [ ] |

**Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Soft skills mastery sets the great technologists apart from the good ones. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Anyone can adopt a new behavior, they just need the right combination of desire, courage, and comfort to get started.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The more closely scenarios bridge a person's past and future experiences, the more useful they are for learning through role-play.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I get inspired when I'm helping other people expand their boundaries. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I can get large groups of people energized and working together for several hours. | [ ] | [ ]  |
