#### _Defining Learning Outcomes 4 - Defining Beliefs_

**Skill Description**

Beliefs represent an Andelan's perspective on the skill in question, their self-perceived abilities to perform the skill, and the relevance of the skill to the role they seek. Beliefs enable (or limit) Andelans from practicing new behaviors and assimilating new knowledge. By stating outright the Beliefs that enable the performance of a skill, Andelans can facilitate conversations with each other over what beliefs they hold, how different they are from the enabling Beliefs required by the skill, and what they can do to refine their beliefs to empower their professional growth. 

**Output**

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, an Andelan should be able to create the following:

1. A set of Beliefs that clearly enable the skill's corresponding Behaviors and justify aquisition of the skill's corresponding Knowledge Units. 

**Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The differences between Growth Mindset and Fixed Mindset | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The differences between a person's beliefs and their faith. | [ ] | [ ]  |

| A list of people who already demonstrate the desired enabling beliefs.    | [ ] | [ ]  |


**Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before defining Beliefs for a Learning Outcome |  |     |
| - **Action:** I ask myself what I believe about this particular skill. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I ask myself what beliefs a Fellow might have about this particular skill. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When creating an initial draft of Beliefs for a Learning Outcome |  |     |
| - **Action:** I ask myself what masters of the corresponding skill might believe. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I read through the Behaviors for the Learning Outcome and ask myself what perspective someone would have to have in order to easily complete the prescribed actions in each context. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I read through the Knowledge Units and identify any information that could contradict beliefs a Fellow might hold. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have an initial draft of Beliefs for a Learning Outcome  **Action:** I refactor them, optimizing for simplicity, conciseness, and impact. | [ ] |    [ ] |


**Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Learning = Identity. We are who we learn to be. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Our beliefs guide our actions.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Uncovering our beliefs is the key to modifying them.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| If we don't believe we can change how we think and behave, we probably never will.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Beliefs should be simple, concise, and easily felt.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
