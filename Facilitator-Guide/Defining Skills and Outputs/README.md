#### _Defining Learning Outcomes 1 - Defining Skill Descriptions & Outputs_

**Skill Description**

Skill Descriptions and Outputs are 2 of the 5 parts of a well-defined Learning Outcome. They are meant to give a quick overview of what the Learning Outcome covers, what skill you can expect to acquire from achieving the outcome, and what work output(s) you can expect to produce as a result of demonstrating your completion of the Learning Outcome. The skill of writing Skill Descriptions and defining Outputs helps you support Andela Fellows in making decisions about what to learn, when to learn it, and how to describe the value they get from achieving the Learning Outcome you've created for them.

**Output**

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, an Andelan should be able to create the following:

1. Several well-defined Skill Descriptions that support Fellows in deciding on whether a Learning Outcome is relevant to them at any given time.
2. Several well-defined Outputs that support Fellows in knowing what to create as a demonstration of their competence and completion of individual Learning Outcomes.

**Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I decide to define a Learning Outcome **Action:** I start by describing (in a few sentences) the skill the Learning Outcome is meant to address. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** Once I've written a draft of the Skill Description for a Learning Outcome I'm defining **Action:** I refactor the Skill Description to be jargon-free and understandable to people who do not already possess the skill. |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When writing a Skill Description **Action:** I use actionable language and simple terms to describe the advantage or use I believe learners get from applying this particular skill. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I'm defining an output for a specific Learning Outcome |  |     |
| - **Action:** I ask myself how a Fellow could demonstrate to me that they've acquired the corresponding skill. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I consider multiple examples of other Outputs already defined for similar skills. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| - **Action:** I compose a realistic Output that matches as closely as possible the type of work tasks the Fellow would perform during the course of their day. | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** After defining an Output for a specific Learning Outcome **Action:** I verify its authenticity and value with other experienced professionals who already possess the corresponding skill. | [ ] |    [ ] |


**Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Skill Descriptions should be easy to understand and inspiring. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The best Outputs are equivalent to the tasks performed by Fellows each day.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Learning Outcomes without Skill Descriptions and Outputs are incomplete because they offer no targets and no goals.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
