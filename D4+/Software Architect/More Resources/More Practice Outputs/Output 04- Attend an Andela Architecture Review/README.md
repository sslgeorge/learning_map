# Output 04- Attend an Andela Architecture Review

- **The Product:** Join an Architecture Review at Andela (reach out to Ebun or Scott to learn when upcoming reviews are happening, or ask them for a recording of a recent review). Architecture reviews at Andela are called when a big problem is identified that requires multiple viewpoints. Examples of when a review might be called include: 
> - Quality has slipped significantly
> - A large boulder is coming up (eg. where data will be stored, how to scale and improve agility)
> - An app has become more relied on than expected and therefore needs to change to handle future development
> - When the technical team has slowed down and does not know how to improve velocity
- **The Process:** Architecture reviews are a time to set direction from a technical point of view-- multiple senior technical people and stakeholders come together to help architect the path forward.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** After the review, make sure you clearly document your review session, including all whiteboarding and decisions that emerged (see an example [here](https://github.com/andela/decisions/issues/23)).

| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I notice notice that my technical team has an upcoming challenge or that technical work is flagging, **Action:** I suggest an Architecture Review. 	|  
| **Context:** When I call an Architecture Review, **Action:** I recruit a diverse set of senior developers and stakeholders to participate.  |
| **Context:** Before I attend an Architecture Review, **Action:** I send an agenda on Slack to outline WAWSF (“What are we solving for”) in our review. |  
| **Context:** When I have a WAWSF for our Review, **Action:** I work with the team to list out what we’re currently doing to accommodate those issues. |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| Building a product is like digging a tunnel-- eventually the tunnel digging gets slower. every shovel full is only 50% effective because dirt caves in a little. An Architecture Review will bring experienced people together to define how we build in structural supports to the tunnel so we get to a place where each shovel dig is more effective. |
