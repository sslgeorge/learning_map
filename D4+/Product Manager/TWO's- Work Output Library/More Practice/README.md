# Where to look for Real World Practice as a Product Manager

Work == Learning. So how do we find Real Work on which to build on? <br><br>

There is good news- There's never a shortage of need for Product Managers. Think about exploring some of the following opportunities to do great work and learn as you build, make mistakes, get feedback, and grow: 

- Apprentice on an Internal Andela Product as a PM
- Apprentice Product Lead Program 
- Go to a Hackathon! You can work as a Product Manager within a team. 
- Volunteer your Services: Angel List & [CatchaFire](https://www.catchafire.org/) are a couple great places to look
- Start a Product yourself-- recruit a team to work with you
