# Output 13- Use your Product

- **The Product:** The best way to really understand the user goals and painpoints of your product is to… be a user! 
- **The Process:** Use your product as an end user. Spend at least one hour as each user, and do every action you can do. Carefully take notes on what makes you happy, what steps are intuitive, what steps are frustrating. 
- **The Follow-Through:** If your product has multiple end users or multiple views, use it from each one, repeating the process throughout.
