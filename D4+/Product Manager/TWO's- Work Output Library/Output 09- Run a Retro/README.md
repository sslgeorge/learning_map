# Output 09- Run a Retro

- **The Product:** After every demo, you should run a 30-60 minute retro with your team. This meeting should cover action items from the previous week, and should allow team members to say: 
> - What went well this week
> - What was ok/meh this week
> - What didn’t go well this week
- **The Process:** Come away with action items to improve on in the next week’s sprint. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Because this will occur every week, set yourself a calendar reminder to reflect on the Feedback you receive (and input into LV to track your progress).
