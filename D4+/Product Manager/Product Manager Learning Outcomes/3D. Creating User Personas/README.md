# Creating User Personas

### Definition
Any product will be designed for a set of end users, and a Product Manager’s job is to know those users so intimately that they can constantly ensure that their team’s product development is in the best interest of the end user. User Persona’s are a critical way for PMs to define their end users, their archetypes, their goals in using the product, their fears, their needs. Personas allow a PM to maintain their focus on User-centred Design. This will allow you to: 
  - Be an advocate for the end user
  - Apply the basics of good UX / UI Design
