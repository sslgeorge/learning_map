# Running Daily Standups

### Definition
One of the activities that you will perform on a daily basis as a Product Manager is Running Daily Standups. The purpose of a standup is to reflect on what your team accomplished in the previous work day, determine priorities for the next day, and identify any blockers that the team faces. 

Block off 5 minutes after each standup to reflect on that day's meeting- what worked, what could have gone better. That way you will be sure to improve every day! This skill involves: 
  - Ability to run daily standups
  - Ability to harness the powers of your team in the direction of your product goal
  - Ability to prioritize features and work against business and product need
