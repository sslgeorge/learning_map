Before starting to work on these Product Manager Learning Objectives, it is important that you have a background in programming in any language. More than one language is helpful, and a familiarity with Front-End development (even if you've never worked on it specifically) as well as basic UI/UX Design and [Visual Design](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/blob/e20268a54c7b18c4c2143b06f8c418246f196013/D1/D1%20Design/Visual%20Design%20Fundamentals/README.md) will be important.
