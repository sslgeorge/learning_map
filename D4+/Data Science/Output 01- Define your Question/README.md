# Output 01- Define your Question

- **The Product:** Before you dive into gathering, cleaning, and analyzing data, it is critical to make sure you are very clear on the precise question you are trying to answer, who you are answering it for, stakeholders who might be impacted by your finding, and any assumptions you are making before getting started. 
- **The Process:** Write up a document that clearly delineates these variables, and begin to determine where you can gather the appropriate data. 
- **The Follow-Through:** Share this document with your team and stakeholders for feedback.

| **Context:** Before I gather any data, **Action:** I define the question(s) that I woule like to answer with that data. |
| **Context:** After I start with a question,  **Action:** I run experiments on my data and see if I am getting closer to any real insights. |
| **Context:** Throughout my gathering and analysis,  **Action:** I constantly revisit my questions and determine if there are other questions that need to be asked (with this data set or an additional one). |
