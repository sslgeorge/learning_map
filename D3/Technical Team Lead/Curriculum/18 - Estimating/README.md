# Outcome 18 - Estimating 

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow is able to facilitate the systematic breakdown of technical work into individual tasks and provide estimates on each to ultimately derive an estimate on the LOE/time required to complete the work

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Evidence of meeting estimates during sprints

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Level of Effort (LOE) | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * The Agile point system | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Factors that affect estimates | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Stretch estimates vs. safety estimates and the relative benefits and drawbacks of each | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * The difference between a task and a project | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * When a task should be broken down into smaller tasks | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I have a large task/project goal **Action:** I leverage the support of my team to break down the task into smaller tasks that can be completed by individuals  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When estimating work **Action:** I break down the request into smaller units that can be more reliably estimated and then total up the individual estimates  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have broken down tasks **Action:** I collaboratively facilitate sessions with my team members to estimate the LOE/time required to complete the tasks  |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I'm estimating a set of decomposed tasks **Action:** I consider the throughput of my team and their relative experience levels at the given tasks  |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When finalizing an estimate for a large project **Action:** I do a "gut check" to determine how much padding is needed to make me confident we can deliver  |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I'm given incomplete information and asked to perform an estimate **Action:** I create a list of needed information, share it with the requestor, and make sure that I collect all items from the appropriate stakesholders before creating any estimates  |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |
| **Context:** When estimating work **Action:** I consider the variances and cause of variances for my estimates on prior, similar projects  |   [ ]   |   [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I believe that having smaller tasks helps me measure the progress of my team  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I believe that properly estimating the LOE of tasks will make me more effective at managing expectations of team members and external stakeholders  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I will continue to get better with estimating with experience  | [ ] | [ ]  |
