# Outcome 17 - Debugging

**Skill Description**
----------
The fellow is able to use their knowledge to facilitate root cause analysis across integrated components developed by the members of their team

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Root cause analysis report of a bug in an existing system


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Root cause analysis | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Common types of bugs introduced by team contributions     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * What does it mean to "reproduce the problem"?     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * How can binary search help with discovering the root cause of problems in software?     | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I attempt to fix a bug **Action:** I reproduce the problem | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When finding the root cause of a bug/problem **Action:** I split up the program into smaller independent components | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When investigating a defect **Action:** I look beyond the immediate cause of the issue to try and find the underlying cause that may cause additional defects if not corrected | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After splitting the program into components **Action:** I run the components in isolation to identify abnormal behavior | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After identifying the component with abnormal behaviour **Action:** I recursively split the component into smaller components while testing sub-components for abnormal behaviour until I have arrived at the smallest problematic component | [ ] | [ ]  |


----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Discovering the root cause of a bug is the first step towards fixing that bug  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Fixing a bug by solving the root cause problem is the most effective and best long term solution for fixing bugs and eliminate future bugs related to that issue   | [ ] | [ ]  |
