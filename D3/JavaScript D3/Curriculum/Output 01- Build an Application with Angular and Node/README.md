# Output 1- Build an Application with Angular and Node

- **The Product:** Using Angular 2(+) as your front end framework and Node/Express as your back end framework, build a real-world app that enables users to share their knowledge. <br>
- **The Process:** To get you started, [fork this repo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld), read through their documentation, and connect to their live API to facilitate the process.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** When you’re done building your application, make sure you test and debug the app completely. 
Then distribute it to a group of Andelans to get their user feedback. Who knows, maybe Andela will want to keep building on your product and use it forever if it’s really amazing…

| **"KBB's"** <br> _What do experts think, do, and feel as they work through this task?_|
|----------|
| </br>| 
| **Knowledge**	| 
| Benefits and drawbacks of Angular as a front-end JavaScript framework 	|  
| Benefits and drawbacks of Node as a back-end JavaScript framework | 
| Definition of TypeScript and why it is important to use	|
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am programming in Angular 2+ or Node.js, **Action:** I always use TypeScript to promote type safety and object oriented code. 	|  
| **Context:** When I am building from a forked GitHub repo, **Action:** I first read through all the specs and gain an overall understanding of the objectives of the program.	|
| **Context:** After I read through the existing code base, **Action:** I outline how I plan to structure my code before I dive in and start development. |  
| **Context:** When I am building a new application, **Action:** I consistently test throughout my process to catch bugs early. | 
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| I can pick up any framework if I understand the architecture behind it. |  
| Using the latest version of JS ES6 and TypeScript communicate that I am on the cutting edge of new technologies and write future-facing code. 	|
