### Work Output 
- **Quantity:** The main distinguishing feature of a D3 JavaScript developer lies in what they have built. They are comfortable  picking up any JavaScript language or framework (front end or back end), whether or not they have used it before. Although they do have insight into the benefits and drawbacks of different frameworks/languages for various product requirements, they are confident applying their skills to implement any combination to build a JavaScript application. 
- **Quality:** A D3 JavaScript developer will always write  idiomatic, clear code and interfaces that are easy to build on top of, and architects and thinks through problems before looking for a solution. They are rigorous in their code structure and cleanliness, and are avid testers who hunt down every single bug (whether in their own code or in their teammates’ code). 
- **Initiative:** Functionally, they are proficient in Node, performance, the browser API and browser compatibility issues. They can use ES5/6/7 and transpile using Babel in order to use the most recent specs when needed. They are fluent in state management, and can use any state management system that their team might have chosen. 

### Team Work
- A D3 JavaScript Developer works effectively with a team and leads by example, as outlined in the [D3 Web Developer](https://github.com/andela/learningmap/tree/master/Phase-C/D3%20Developer).
