# Outcome 03 - Networking

Skill Description
-----------------
A person with this skill can work with network interfaces, routing tables, and ports to configure a device on a network. 

Outputs
-------
- **Task:** Using an existing project (either yours or a fellow programmer’s), complete the following operations:
  - Display network interfaces
  - Display network routing table
  - Set up port forwarding from one host to another
  - View all open and connected ports on a system
- **Resources:**  Use a network firewall to control access to a system; Use a subnet mask to allocate IP addresses on a network
- **Include:** You can pair program, or ask a fellow Developer for a project to work with for more “real world” practice.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before setting up a network **Action:** I use a subnet mask to define the available number of IP addresses | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I assign an IP address to a machine **Action:** I assign it using a subnet mask | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I assign an IP address to a machine **Action:** I assign both IPv4 & IPV6 address | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am setting up a Firewall  **Action:** I list and set rules to tell the Firewall what attributes are “good” and “bad” | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I see anything unusual in my Firewall log **Action:** I compare it with frequently abused ports and services and block any that might be harmful | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** At least twice a month **Action:** I scan my network to find open ports, close any that are not needed, and block those that look dubious | [ ] | [ ] |
