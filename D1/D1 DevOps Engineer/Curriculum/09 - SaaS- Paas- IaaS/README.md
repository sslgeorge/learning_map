# Objective 09- SaaS, PaaS, & Iaas

## Skill Description
-------
A person with this skill can explain what SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are and the differences between them. They can use each platform to create additional efficiencies when running a software application. 

## Outputs
-------
- **Task:** On either an existing or new application, create and push your app to a PaaS and scale it to multiple instances.
- **Resources:** Choose an appropriate PaaS of your choice. 
- **Involve:** N/A

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I create a user to access a IaaS resource **Action:** I ensure the user's permission is restricted | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I deploy my application to an IaaS **Action:** I deploy critical components of the application across multiple Availability Zones for redundancy | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I store data on a IaaS storage service **Action:** I encrypt the data | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I provision a machine on a IaaS **Action:** I put proper monitoring in place to gather metrics | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I look for a PaaS that has the app runtime support required to run my app code | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I look for a PaaS that has the database that my app needs  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I check if there are any PaaS-specific config files needed to run my app properly | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I put together a list of dependencies needed to run my app | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** After I deploy my app to a PaaS **Action:** I check that it is running and accessible | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my app instances cannot handle the amount of incoming requests **Action:** I use the PaaS to scale the instances | [ ] | [ ]

## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt          | Demonstrated |
|:------------------|:------------------:|:------------:|
| PaaS eases the pain of deployment and takes care of the overhead of deploying applications | [ ] | [ ] |
| PaaS allows me to focus only on application development-- it takes care of the rest | [ ] | [ ] |
| PaaS makes release management easy (rolling back code and deploying code) | [ ] | [ ] |
