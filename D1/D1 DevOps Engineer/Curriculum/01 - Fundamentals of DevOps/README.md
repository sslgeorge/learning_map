# 01-  Fundamentals of DevOps

Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can explain the role of a DevOps engineer within a product & engineering team, and how they fit into a Software Development Lifecycle. They can clearly articulate the tasks central to a DevOps engineer’s work, both relational and technical, and the tools used to do them.



Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Write and share a brief description the place of DevOps in the Software Development Cycle. 
- **Resources:** You can use a blog post, infographics, a screencast, or any other medium you choose. 
- **Include:** Share this with your team.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I join a new project as a DevOps engineer **Action:** I learn the basics of how my product’s languages and frameworks are used and deployed | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When determining the best process to implement as a DevOps engineer **Action:** I choose the one that maximizes efficiency without losing any function. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a DevOps problem to solve **Action:** I break it down into smaller pieces and choose the appropriate tool to resolve each. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** If none of the traditional DevOps tools to meet my needs **Action:** I come up with my own. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am asked to solve an issue or bug for my team **Action:** I consider the scope of the work, set reasonable and realistic timelines, and present alternatives if the work asked of me will be impossible to accomplish in the time given. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When estimating the time it will take me to complete some work **Action:** I systematically break down the challenge into individual tasks and provide estimates on each. | [ ] | [ ]  
| **Context:** Before putting forth any outputs (code commits, emails, Slack, Development Environment setup, etc) **Action:** I check and double check to review that they meet standards. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am working to resolve a problem for my team **Action:** I pay attention to the context of the problem to create thorough solutions that address the entire issue and any corresponding issues. | [ ] | [ ]  |




## **Beliefs**

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| DevOps is a process, not just the tools I use to implement that process. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I can come up with my own tools to make my DevOps process work if the traditional ones do not meet my needs. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| A great DevOps engineer cares deeply about efficiency. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Speed is key-- the faster I can fix a customer issue, the more effective my product can be. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| DevOps exists to kill bureaucracy and move fast. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| If I bring in the wrong tools or use them in the wrong way it can introduce more bureaucracy. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I must be able to defend how I came up with a time estimate that it would take me to complete some work, even if it wound up not being accurate.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
