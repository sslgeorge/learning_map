# Outcome 04 - Configuration, Change Management, & Tools

Skill Description
-----------------
A person with this skill is comfortable implementing the standard processes, techniques, and tools to manage changes in a development environment. They can articulate what configuration and change management are, and the problems they solve.  

Outputs
-------
- **Task:** On an existing project, perform an audit of the system security, set up alerts to be delivered to technical staff via email or SMS, and generate reports that track the changes of your project.
- **Resources:** Use a configuration management tool of your choice (and be able to explain why you chose that tool) 
- **Include:**  You can pair program, or ask a fellow Developer for a project to work with for more “real world” practice.

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:----------------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I create configuration scripts **Action:** I setup a test harness to apply TDD to the scripts | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I need to provision machines **Action:** I use a configuration tool | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I create configuration scripts **Action:** I test and validate them locally before deploying | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to implement and track change management **Action:** I use Tripwire to monitor file integrity and perform an audit of system security. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When my project has SLA’s **Action:** I use Tripwire (or an alternative tool) to set up alerts to be delivered to technical staff via email or SMS and generate reports to ensure they are being met. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am choosing a configuration management tool **Action:** I consider integration with my other tools, as well as the architecture and templating language that I am working with | [ ] | [ ]  |
