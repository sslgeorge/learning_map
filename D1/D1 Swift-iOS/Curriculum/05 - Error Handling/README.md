# Outcome 5 - Error Handling
## Skill Description

A person with this skill can handle errors in an iOS Application, identifying and catching these errors during development, to prevent the application from crashing at runtime.

## Output

Create a Swift Playground project that handles errors generated from bad inputs into a function and performs a different operation to cater for the error thrown that allows for normal operation of the application.


## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The properties of common error class in Swift `NSError` | [ ] | [ ] |
| Types of Error in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to handle errors in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |

-------

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When throwing Errors that have steps or categories, **Action:** I create an enumerated `ErrorType` that throws different Errors in steps to increase flexibility in the Error Handling | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to perform an operation that could fail, **Action:** I use a try block to catch any error and present a self-explanatory message if it fails | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When errors are thrown, **Action:** I provide user-friendly error messages to end users where appropriate | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Applications can crash at runtime if errors are not handled | [ ] | [ ] |
| I can write applications that prevent runtime crashes and gracefully handles errors | [ ] | [ ] |
