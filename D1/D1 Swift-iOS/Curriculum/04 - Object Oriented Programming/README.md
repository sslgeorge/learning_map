# Outcome 4 - Object Oriented Programming
## Skill Description

A person with this skill can apply O.O.P Principles in Swift, write concise and modular code using extensions, protocols, and other Swift proprietary structures.

## Output

Create an extension of the `String` class with a method that returns an Array of words in a sentence called `words.`


## Objectives
### Knowledge

| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Namespace referencing in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
| The difference between Structs and Classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| Use cases for Structs and Classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| Enumerations with Conditionals | [ ] | [ ] |
| Advantages of using Computed Properties in Classes | [ ] | [ ] |

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want a collection of methods, properties, or attributes that I need to re-use, **Action:** I create a Class that contains these methods and attributes, and create instances of that Class when I need to | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to avoid having multiple instances of the same class **Action:** I create singletons or Class constants | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I create a Class that that needs some existing behaviors already present in another Class, **Action:** I create a Class that inherits these behaviors | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, functions, and variables, **Action:**  I import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values, **Action:** I make use of Structs instead of classes | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to extend the functionality of an existing Class, **Action:** I use the `extension` keyword to add methods or properties | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The essentials of object oriented programming help me write well decoupled and reusable code | [ ] | [ ] |
| Inheritance and Abstraction will prevent me from writing duplicate blocks of code | [ ] | [ ] |
| Computed Properties will improve my code quality by abstracting property procedures | [ ] | [ ] |
| Namespaces gives me the ability to explicitly reference a particular package | [ ] | [ ] |
| Protocols and Extension helps me implement Inheritance and Abstraction in Swift | [ ] | [ ] |
