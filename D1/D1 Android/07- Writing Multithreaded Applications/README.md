# Outcome 7- Writing Multithreaded Applications

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use multithreading to allow their application to run multiple tasks at once. They can explain the concept of multithreading, identify when it’s being used, and outline what is happening in the background of concurrent events. 

## Output
- **Task:** Create a application that allows the user to select as many files as they want to download at the same time. 
- **Resources:** Use multithreading to handle which ones download first, how to deal with a failed download, and how to allow concurrent actions on the application while the downloads execute. 
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Practiced |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to make concurrency possible in my application, **Action:** I use multithreading. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When multiple threads need to access the same resource, **Action:** I use synchronized blocks. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to reduce idle time and maximize my CPU, **Action:** I create a multithreaded environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am building multithreading into my application, **Action:** I consider whether there is a library that can help me do my work more effectively. | [ ] | [ ]  |

|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Multithreading is one of the most powerful features in Java that makes it stand out among other languages. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Lack of understanding of multithreading architecture leads to improper library use and an inability to troubleshoot. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Multithreading means freedom. WIthout it, my user would be stuck while a task completed. | [ ] | [ ] |
