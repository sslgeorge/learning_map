### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When designing the UI of any Android app **Action:** I take advantage of the different layouts available and edit the XML generated to suit my app's purpose.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am designing an Android app  **Action:** I consider the range of devices it might be used on. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am designing the feel and functionality of my Android application  **Action:**  I plan to manage the following 3 “conversations”: 
| Interaction of User with the screen |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Interaction of Screen with the Device |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Interaction of Device with datastore |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When adding components to my Android app **Action:** I make use of the styles.xml sheet available for me in the resources directory (res) to style the components. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** While I am building my Android application  **Action:**  I clearly document my code and include readme files to help someone get set up easily. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When organising the resources used on my Android app **Action:** I keep all resources such as images, drawables, layouts, strings (etc.) in the provided resources directory and reference them through the R class. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After I get a working Android UI **Action:**  I go back and refactor to improve my code layout and readability patterns. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
