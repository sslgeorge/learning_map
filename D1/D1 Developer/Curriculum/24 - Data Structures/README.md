# Outcome 24 - Data Structures

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basic concepts of data structures, the most common data structures (linear data structures and hash tables), and  how to identify the most efficient structure to use in a given situation.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Screenshots of passed HackerRank exercises on lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables as suggested by Success Department

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When designing a solution for a programming problem **Action:** I use the data structures that are most efficient for the needs of the problem | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When using data structures that are already implemented in a programming language or framework **Action:** I gain an understanding of how efficient the data structures are | [ ] | [ ] |
