# Outcome 32 - Security

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the basics of application security including authentication, authorization, encryption of sensitive data, and input validation.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A project implementing authentication, authorization, encryption of sensitive data, and input validation


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| The differences between authentication and authorization | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The benefits of authorization | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The importance of encrypting sensitive data | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to encrpyt sensitive data     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The importance of validating input   | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to validate input      | [ ] | [ ]  |
| CEH best practices and how they support security  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| How to follow security "optics": | | | 
| - never doing anything (whether communication or implementation) that is not classified `White Hat`|[ ] |[ ] | 
| - never doing anything that is classified as `Grey Hat`, `Black Hat` |[ ] |[ ] |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When building a feature that requires users to have private access to their data **Action:** I use the appropriate authentication mechanism | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When building a feature that requries users to have different levels of access to data **Action:** I use the appropriate authorization mechanism | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When building a feature to store potentially sensitive data **Action:** I use the appropriate encryption mechanism to encrypt the data before saving | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When building a feature that takes user input **Action:** I validate and sanitize the input at both the front-end and backend | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am tinkering with code,  **Action:** I always use CEH Best Practices to ensure security | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am joining a new team,  **Action:** I never do anything without required permission from authorities-- I do not assume. | [ ] | [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Contributing to insecure code, puts my users, my client, and Andela at tremendous risk | [ ] | [ ] |
| A secure application builds trust between my product and its users | [ ] | [ ] |
| The security of my code merits the trust of my product's users | [ ] | [ ] |
