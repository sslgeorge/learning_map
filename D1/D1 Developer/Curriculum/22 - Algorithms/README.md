# Outcome 22 - Algorithms

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands what an algorithm is, the most common sort algorithms, and Big-O analysis. The Fellow also knows how to choose existing algorithms based on the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm given the problem they are trying to solve.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:
