# Outcome 35 - Software Development Environments

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the proper use of environments, including the appropriate usage of development, testing, integration, staging, and production environments. The Fellow also understands how application code progresses from one environment to the next.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. A project that has multiple environments
2. Supporting documentation for above project that explains how code passes through each environment and why
