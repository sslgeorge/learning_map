# Outcome 14 - Problem Solving & Critical Thinking

## Skill Description

The Fellow is able to use generic methods (when they are available) or ad hoc methods (when generic methods are not available) in an orderly manner to find solutions to problems. The Fellow utilizes problem solving processes and sequences to effectively solve complex problems.

As a Software Developer, you will continually be encountering and resolving problems. They may be related to your team, or they may be related to your code base, but they will always exist. You are first and foremost a problem solver.


## Output

After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. Written description of a coding problem I recently solved and the steps taken to solve the problem-- *see example checklist below for inspiration*
2. Written description of a non-coding problem I recently solved and the steps taken to solve the problem


### Knowledge

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior | Practiced | Observed |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| | | |
| **Context:** When I identify a problem that requires my attention | | |
| - **Action:** I accurately define the problem and its context | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I define the process I will use to solve the problem, rather than immediately taking action (e.g. beginning to write code) | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I ensure the problem solving process is appropriate for the specific task | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When none of the generic problem solving methods apply to a specific problem | | | 
| - **Action:** I ideate ad hoc methods to solve the problem | [ ] | [ ] |
| - **Action:** I collaborate with others for a second opinion | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I find myself using “brute force”, guess and check methods to find a solution to a problem **Action:** I stop and find more efficient and procedural methods | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief | Felt | Demonstrated |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| | | |
| Critical thinking will enable me to unlock the opportunities in every problem | [ ] | [ ] |
| I can solve any problem that stands in the way of my success | [ ] | [ ] |
| I am a critical thinker and can make a valuable contribution to any group | [ ] | [ ] |
| My ability to solve problems will create opportunities for me | [ ] | [ ] |
| My perspectives are insightful and add value to others | [ ] | [ ] |
| I only use brute force to code my way to a solution if I have exhausted other potential solutions | [ ] | [ ] |
| I am obsessed with finding the most effective solutions | [ ] | [ ] |
| I don't spend time looking for the solution to something that is not yet a problem | [ ] | [ ] |
| Not every problem requires a technical solution | [ ] | [ ] |
| Hurdles encountered in development are the normal path, not the exception. | [ ] | [ ] |
