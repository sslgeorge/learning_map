# Visual Design Fundamentals

## Skill Description
A person with this skill creates clean, visually pleasing designs that communicate their intended information clearly and simply. They solve design problems by bringing ideas to life in a tangible way, and use design concepts to give brands a unique style and voice. In addition to creating work that represents their expertise, and they are able to explain the design concepts and decisions behind their work. 

## Output
- **Build:** Create a wireframe, infographic, or other visual design for a real team at Andela or outside of Andela. Be sure to start your design with a deep understanding of what it intends to communicate and a moodboard that you can gather design elements on. You can practice by volunteering for a nonprofit who needs design support on either of these sites!

- **Refactor:** The first build is just the beginning-- gather user feedback, do a design critique with the team you’re working for and/or groups at Andela, and refactor at least once (most likely more once). 
- **Reflect:** Make careful notes after each critique noting what worked for users in your design, what did not work, and how you addressed their ideas. This will be extremely instrumental to your learning. 

## Additional Output: 
You should practice as many designs as possible! As you amass designs, consider creating a portfolio. Your portfolio will house only your best designs, and the design of your portfolio will be a design in and of itself. 99% of how you are judged as a designer comes down to your portfolio and the design items in it.

### Behaviors
| Observable Behavior | Practiced | Observed |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **Context:** Before I start my design, **Action:** I clarify exactly what I want to communicate and which components are the most important.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** Before I start my design, **Action:** I put together a moodboard to gather design components.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am conveying information through design, **Action:** I keep in mind that the human mind can only effectively hold 5 things at once.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am choosing what to prioritize in my design, **Action:** I display the top 3 priorities first.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my eye hits a design, **Action:** I should know instantly what priority is the most important by its location, font, color, and size.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am choosing a color scheme, **Action:** I choose the minimum amount of contrast to get the job done. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am drawing attention to an object on my design, **Action:** I choose whether to use size, boldness, or color to do so.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am inputting an image or object into my visual design, **Action:** I make sure that the minimum white space between it and something else is the size of that object.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am assessing the information density and prioritization of my design, **Action:** I squint my eyes and see what stands out from my design. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am choosing a typography for my design, **Action:** I consider the mood, tone, and style I want to convey through my design. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have a design that is illustration heavy, **Action:** I choose a typeface that fits the style of my illustration (“harmonizes” with my design).  | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs
| Embodied Belief | Felt | Demonstrated |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| In visual design, every single thing is either a direction or a distraction. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Form is inextricable from function-- if you change the form of a chair, you will change how someone sits on it. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Perfect symmetry is not interesting-- purposeful asymmetry will help my audience prioritize information on a page. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The most important part of design is that every item on my page is intentional. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Color conveys meaning. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Learning design comes from experience, and from solving a real world problem for real users. | [ ] | [ ] |
| I can practice design every day-- Even when responding to Slack messages, I am practicing conveying information in order of importance! | [ ] | [ ] |
