# Output 06- Conduct a UI/UX Test with Users

- **The Product:** On an internal Andela product (or external product) run a UI/UX Testing session with real users. Try to keep your session specific to one feature. For example, you may want to test how Users interact with the navigation bar of a particular product.   <br>
- **The Process:** Use both observation and interview questions to gather feedback from users as they test the product.   <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Finalize your project with an analysis of your findings-- remember to include the kinds of users, number of participants, findings, and feature or function suggestions that emerged according to user needs

| **Knowledge**	| 
| What components of a product require usability testing 	|  
| How to create test cases for UI/UX components | 
| </br> | 
| **Behaviors** 	| 
|  **Context:** When I am setting up a user test, **Action:** I let users know that everything they say is valid and valuable, and that they should share their immediate reactions. 	|  
| **Context:** When I am running a user test, **Action:** I try not to answer questions they ask and instead observe and encourage them to share their thoughts without jumping in.  |
| **Context:** After I run a user test, **Action:** I synthesize and condense the information into key takeaways to see what patterns emerged for areas of improvement.  |  
| </br> | 
| **Beliefs**	| 
| A product is ultimately built for a user-- even a technically “fancy” product has failed if a user cannot use it easily and effectively.  |
