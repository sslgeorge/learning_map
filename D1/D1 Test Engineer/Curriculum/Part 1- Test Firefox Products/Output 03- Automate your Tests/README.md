# Output 03- Automate your Tests

- **The Product:** Mozilla’s testing team has already written a few test scripts in Python and JavaScript that you can access on their GitHub account-- take a look at them and see if they will automate the test requirements you are looking at effectively.  <br>
- **The Process:** Most likely, you’ll need to either add to the existing scripts or write new ones entirely.  <br>
- **The Follow-Through:** Review to make sure your test scrips run as expected.
