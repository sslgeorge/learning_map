# Module 5: Object Oriented Programming in PHP

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use PHP as an Object Oriented Programming language to create more compact and effective code. 


## Outputs
----------
Using OOP PHP and object serialization, create a program that can add, retrieve, update and delete meanings of urban words thrown in as arguments to the class functions.

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to reuse a collection of methods, properties, or attributes **Action:**  I create an instance of a class that contains those collections. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:**  When a class in my PHP app needs some existing behaviors already present in another class **Action:** I create a class that inherits these behaviors. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to access classes, functions, and variables **Action:**  I import the encapsulating namespace and reference them accordingly. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## Beliefs


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| The essentials of object oriented programming allow me to write well-decoupled and reusable code.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| Inheritance and Abstraction are essential techniques that can be employed to avoid writing duplicated blocks of code. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
