# Module 1: PHP Language Basics
## Skill Description
A person with this skill can explain why PHP is a powerful language for creating web programs, and what the language constructs and coding standards are when using PHP. They can set up and configure PHP for development and production environments, and use PHP to create simple web programs.

## Outputs
Using PHP, build a program that works with data files-- be sure to plan it out in “plain English” ahead of time, including edge case analysis, and to adhere to proper PHP style guides.

## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I getting started with a new PHP application **Action:** I set up and configure my environment. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After installing and configuring PHP on my machine **Action:** I run a test to ensure it is working. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am writing a program in PHP **Action:** I plan not only to get my code working now, but also write out an edge case analysis of any issues that could arise in the future. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am planning out a PHP program **Action:** I first write out the stakeholder expectations and the app structure in “plain English.” | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have written my PHP program plan in English **Action:** I then “translate” that to smaller pieces that I can create in PHP and compose Unit Tests for each. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have determined the key pieces of my PHP app and written unit tests **Action:** I build one small piece at a time, testing and refactoring as I go. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I want to define variables or constants **Action:** I use names that are descriptive of what the variables or constants contain.| [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have procedures to run that depend on a certain input or value **Action:** I use a conditional expression to cater for the optional procedure to run. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have to loop through a collection of data **Action:** I use Break and Continue for the process.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to create, reference, or manipulate data **Action:** I simply assign the value to a variable and let PHP automatically detect the type. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I want to perform an arithmetic operation **Action:**  I use one of the available arithmetic operators.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I write any code in PHP **Action:** I ensure it follows the PSR-2 standards.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I am working on a project that involves several PHP files **Action:**   I ensure it follows the PSR-4 autoloading standard.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:**  When I need to retrieve the values of a GET and POST request **Action:** I make use of a Super Global variable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can jump right in and use PHP even if I have never programmed before. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Knowing how to use the available operators in PHP allows me to perform better computations.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Using variables and constants appropriately makes my programs more efficient and readable.|   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| I write code as if I can see the future-- I am always prepared for the edge cases that might arise. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Style and syntax matter when writing my PHP code: They will reduce visual parsing time for my team and will allow my application to grow and thrive into the future. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
