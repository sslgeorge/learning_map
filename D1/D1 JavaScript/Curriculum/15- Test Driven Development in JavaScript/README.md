# Outcome 15- Test Driven Development in JavaScript

## Skill Description 
A person with this skill can explain the importance of TDD as a software development process in general, and consistently uses TDD in their JavaScript programming process. They are familiar with the tool options they have for testing in JavaScript, can explain the benefits and drawbacks of each, and can effectively use at least one. 

## Output
- **Task:** Test a simple JavaScript application you have already written as is, and try to work through fixing any bugs/errors. 
- **Resources:** Using Test Driven Development, go back and rebuild the application, including TDD steps along the way.
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:| 
| **Context:** Before I even write my functions or procedures for a JavaScript program, **Action:** I first write tests. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When a test fails, **Action:** I write the minimum code to make the test pass. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have written the minimal code for a method or function, **Action:** I refactor to improve it to acceptable standards. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:** When I want to verify object behavior during a test, **Action:** I use a mock object. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to verify indirect outputs of the system under test, **Action:** I use a test spy. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:| 
| Test Driven Development leads to more effective code. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Refactoring is a necessary part of the TDD process. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Test driven development is fun-- the simple steps and pattern add a structure to my process and make it (even) more enjoyable! | [ ] | [ ] |
| Testing code is even more important than shipping code. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| There are plenty of testing tools out there-- there is no excuse not to write effective, thorough tests. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
