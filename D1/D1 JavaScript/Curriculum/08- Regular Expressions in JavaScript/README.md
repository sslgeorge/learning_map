### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I have a text-manipulation task I need to do, **Action:** I consider whether I can use a regular expression to make it easier. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When my regular expression will remain constant, **Action:** I write it as a literal for better performance. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I know the regular expression pattern will be changing (or is coming from another source), **Action:** I use the constructor function to compile regular expressions. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to know whether a pattern is found in a string, **Action:** I use the ‘test’ or ‘search’ method. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need more information on a pattern, **Action:** I use the ‘exec’ or ‘match’ methods. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to match certain patterns of strings with another string, **Action:** I use Regex. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have email address or URL validation, **Action:** I use Regex. | [ ] | [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Proficiency with regular expressions will make me not only a better JavaScript developer, but a more powerful programmer overall. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Skimming the surface of regex, it is fun and easy. Diving deeper and combining regular expression syntax things can get confusing quickly. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Regular expressions are both awkward and useful. | [ ] | [ ] |
