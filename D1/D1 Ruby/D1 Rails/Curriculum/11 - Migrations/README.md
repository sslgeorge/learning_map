# Outcome 11 - Migrations

Skill Description
----------
A person with this skill can use migrations to create and evolve their application's database schema. They can also set up their application for future success by building migration into their version control system, allowing other developers on their team to roll out new releases and bring the database up to date.  


Outputs
----------
- **Task:** Create a simple content management database that has multiple sections and pages.
- **Resources:**  Generate the Subject, Page, and Section models, and then write and run migrations with appropriate subjects and pages, foreign keys, and indexes
- **Include:** Share your application with your team and get feedback on whether the development is clear enough for them to jump in and start working with it.
