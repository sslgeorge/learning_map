**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans know what SQL is, the different types of databases, examples of databases and how to design basic database tables.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When faced with a data modeling problem **Action:** I create the required table structures diagrammatically | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I require a subset of data from a table **Action:** I create SQL queries to extract the specific data needed | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to create table relationships **Action:** I specify a foreign key that identifies the related record in the related table |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to specify fields in a table design **Action:** I make use of data types adequately to ensure the data stored is well formatted | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Databases should be used whenever I am solving a problem that requires persistent data |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| There is no one database solution that addresses all data storage needs |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Investing time in structuring my data properly helps me create better performing applications |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
