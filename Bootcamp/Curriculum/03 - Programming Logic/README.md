# Outcome 3 - Programming Logic

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans  understand the fundamentals of how to break down problems into programmable logic, and be able to write reusable functions. Additionally, they will be able to identify common problem areas where the performance of a program might be affected.


**Outputs**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to complete the following:

1. 7 Andelabs exercises from the Bootcamp category within the first week of Bootcamp.
2. A function to generate prime numbers from 0 to n with asymptotic analysis
3. A function to generate Fibonacci sequence from 0 to n with asymptotic analysis


**Objectives**

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am writing logic that is repeated in my codebase **Action:** I make use of functions to facilitate reuse of code | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I write a function **Action:** I return a value that represents the desired output for that function | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am faced with a programming challenge **Action:** I break it down into a series of steps that can be represented using functions |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** After writing a working program, before delivering **Action:** I always check to see if there are ways to make it run faster and/or conserve system resources like internet bandwidth or memory | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing code **Action:** I follow best practices with respect to naming and code organization to make sure my code is easy to read and understand for the next developer who will work on it | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Programming languages may differ but the core logic behind how programs and computers work are the same | [ ] | [ ] |
| I solve problems. My computer follows instructions. Together we can impact the world | [ ] | [ ] |
