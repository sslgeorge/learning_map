# Outcome 4 - Object-Oriented Programming

**Skill Description**
----------
Aspiring Andelans  understand what classes and objects are, how to design simple data models, and how to apply object-oriented programming principles to solve basic problems.


**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, I should be able to create the following:

1. GitHub repo containing a real-world problem modeled using OOP while taking advantage of inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism and the other OOP concepts.


**Objectives**
----------

## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Definition of a class and an object | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Definition of common OOP principles and concepts |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| * Examples of languages that support OOP and languages that are purely procedural | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Examples of where OOP can be successfully applied | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * How to design simple data models | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * Key differences between object-oriented programming and procedural programming and benefits of OOP over the latter | [ ] |    [ ] |
| * What metaprogramming is | [ ] |    [ ] |

## **Behaviors**


| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am faced with a data modeling problem **Action:** I attempt to identify all the objects, and each object's properties and their behaviours | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When creating a class model for an object **Action:** I define my object's attributes as variables and behaviour as methods within my class | [ ] |    [ ] |
| **Context:** When working on codebase that I foresee will grow dramatically **Action:** I strive to ensure my code is DRY by building reusable components |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When modeling data using OOP **Action:** I take advantage of inheritance to ensure I am reusing code as much as possible | [ ] |    [ ] |

----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Modeling my code in an object oriented way helps me think about problems in a structured way |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Modeling my code in an object oriented way helps me write sustainable and reusable program components |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
