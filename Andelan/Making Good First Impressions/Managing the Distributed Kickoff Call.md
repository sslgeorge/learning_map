## Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Observed      | Mastered |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before getting on my actual kickoff call **Action:** I do a test call to ensure everything is working as expected and that the lighting and setting are appropriate. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I have a scheduled call **Action:** I book a room in advance. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When starting a call with new people I haven’t met  **Action:** I ask the participants to introduce themselves. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When someone is asking me to introduce myself at the very beginning of a conversation  **Action:** I maintain eye contact when responding.  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am tempted to say any filler word “um” or “so” or “like” **Action:** I simply pause and wait for my brain to catch up. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am listening to someone over a video call  **Action:** I give them visual cues that I am listening and engaged (nodding, etc.). | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When there are multiple people on my call **Action:** I stay engaged even when I am not speaking or when a question is addressed to another person. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am taking notes  **Action:** I let the other person know that I am doing so in order to ensure they know why I’m looking down and away from the call. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am on a video call **Action:** I look at the camera when talking, not at the person’s picture. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am nervous before a call **Action:** I take 3-5 deep breaths from the diaphragm to help myself slow down my nervous system and enhance my calm. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I am speaking to be understood  **Action:** I use these tools: 
|<li> Pausing </li> | [ ] | [ ]  |
|<li> Pacing (speed of speech)</li> | [ ] | [ ]  |
|<li> Checking in (asking if the listener understands) </li> | [ ] | [ ]  |
|<li> Acknowledging communication challenges (“If you don’t understand something please stop me, I’m ok with that.”)</li> | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When someone asks me a question  **Action:** I initially make eye contact with the camera or person when replying to show thoughtfulness. | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I receive an answer to a question **Action:** I acknowledge and engage by confirming understanding through visual or verbal cues. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have more questions at the end of a conversation **Action:** I ask if there's time left rather than just assuming there is not | [ ] | [ ] |
