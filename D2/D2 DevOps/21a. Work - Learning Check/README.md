## Work == Learning Check

You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work. 

--- 

1. Take a holistic look at your application, your load balancing, your servers. 
>> Is it scalable? Test its performance and conduct a gap analysis. How would you recommend it to become more scalable or optimized? 
  
2. Look back at your debugging process and how you look at your logs to check for errors. How could you automate that process? Using whatever automation tools or scripting languages are best for your goal, set up a job that will check your logs for you and notify you when something is wrong. 

3. *On Partner Work:* Identify instances of scaling and automation on your Partner’s products. Test performance of the products currently, and use your knowledge of your Partner's business objectives to look to the future and anticipate what might not scale, and what they could do to prepare. 

4. *Thought Experiment:* Election application: You are the DevOps Engineer for one party during a country-wide election. Your team has been tasked with building a system for a polling center, and you’ll need to build it to scale. What architecture would you use? What are the tiers? What are the considerations you need to think about for scalability? For security? What would the infrastructure be? 
>> As you scale, how can you do that while also making sure everything you are doing can be automated?
