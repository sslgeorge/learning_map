# Work == Learning Check: Number 3

You've learned a lot of knowledge, facts, and tools so far. Time to put them into practice to see if you really understand how to use and embody the skill, and where you might need to patch up some gaps in your knowledge! 

Choose any or all of the following Outputs or Thought Experiments to work though. It will be most effective if you work with a Peer or mentor to get feedback on your work. 

--- 

1. **Thought Experiment:** Extract your work from sprint planning session on your Partner engagement
>> If a developer in your session says “I’m going to work on X” or if a Marketing person says “We are going to demo this to x client at x time,” how do you as a DevOps team member know what that means for the work you need to do? Will Marketing need a testing server for their demo? Will the development team need deployment support? What questions do you need to ask to make sure you have clarity in your upcoming responsibilities?  
  
2. **Work Output/ On Partner Work:** Dig into your existing documentation of processes, implementations, and designs. Note what works well in the documents and where you are confused-- could you pick up and go with what is recorded there? Rewrite the documentation (or at least a subset of it) and ask a teammate to try to follow it to make sure your communication is clear. 

3. **Thought Experiment:** You get to your Partner project and the documentation is not clear or simply does not exist-- what do you do?
