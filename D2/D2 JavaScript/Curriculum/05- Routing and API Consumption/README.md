# Outcome 5- Routing and API Consumption (with AngularJS) 

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can define routes to move between multiple views in their application, as well as effectively consume APIs.
	

## Output
- **Task:**  Create a simple application that allows different authors to add, edit, and delete comments
- **Resources:** Use services to wrap the APIs your application consumes, observables to pull in data asynchronously, and models to persist data from the database.
- **Include:** N/A

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** Before I create a route, **Action:** I need to import the router module. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to make asynchronous requests from JSON, **Action:** I use Angular’s inbuilt services. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When the component I am routing to is nested within another component, **Action:** I use a selector. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When my application consumes an API, **Action:** I encapsulate the API with a service and inject it into my controller. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have an encapsulated API in my controller, **Action:** I can later reuse that model in different controllers and test more easily. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
