# Outcome 1- ES6 (EMCAScript 6) 

## Skill Description
A person with this skill is fluent in the newest syntax of ES6 implementation syntax and uses it in their JavaScript programming when developing new programs. They can explain why the updates to the syntax are important for the functionality and effectiveness of the code. 

# Output
- **Task**: Take a previously written piece of an existing program that you or a colleague had written in an older scripting version. Refactor to “translate” it to ES6. 
- **Resources:** Use ES6
- **Include:** Go over the differences and changes with your colleague.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I am programming in JavaScript, **Action:** I use the latest syntax available to ensure my code remains relevant and is as clean as possible. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to assign enumerable properties of one or more source objects onto a destination object, **Action:** I use object property assignment. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to find an element in an array in ES6, **Action:** I use the built-in element finding function. | [ ] | [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to validate data that is being passed to an object, **Action:** I use a proxy. | [ ] | [ ] |

|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Using ES6 for any new program shows that I am up to speed on the newest and latest languages out there in the world of technology. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Some of the changes in ES6 are just syntactic sugar, but a few will change the way I’m able to program. | [ ] | [ ] |
| ES6 syntax is simpler, which means that it is less error prone. | [ ] | [ ] |
