# Outcome 10- Flux Architecture and Immutability 

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use Flux Architecture and Immutability without a library, building a foundation of knowledge that will allow them to be more flexible in their programming and to “see under the hood” when using it in conjunction with React. They can explain the core tenets of the Flux pattern, and why many programmers rely on the power of Flux. 


## Output
- **Task:** Take an application written in a pattern that is *not* Flux, and outline how you would change it.
- **Resources:** Use any medium you choose.
- **Include:** Go over your outline with a teammate and discuss which version would be more effective and why.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I need to assure that dependent operations happen in the correct order, **Action:** I use Flux architecture and implement `waitsFor.` |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am planning on working with a scalable application in React, **Action:** I first learn the basics of the Flux pattern to understand what is going on “under the hood.” |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
