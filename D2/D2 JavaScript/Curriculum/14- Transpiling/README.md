# Outcome 14- Transpiling 

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can use various build tools to transpile their code. Through this ability they are able to (and do) consistently try out new specs in JavaScript, play with new features, and stay up to date on the latest technologies. 

## Output
- **Task:** Find a new spec or feature that you have not used in JavaScript before that is a very recent development.
- **Resources:** Use Babel or another transpiler tool to run the code in your browser. 
- **Include:** Share a short blog post on the spec or features and what impact they had on your development.

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want to try out a new feature or new specs as soon as they are available, **Action:** I use a transpiler to communicate my code to the browser. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I discover something that works or doesn’t work in a new spec, **Action:** I let the spec writer and the community know. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to write future facing code, **Action:** I use a transpiler. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am choosing a transpiler, **Action:** I consider the tradeoff between being able to use the next and newest technology with the risk of incompatibility in the future, and choose my own level of “instability tolerance.” |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
