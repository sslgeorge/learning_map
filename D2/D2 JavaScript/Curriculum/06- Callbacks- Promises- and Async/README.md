# Outcome 6- Callbacks, Promises, and Async

## Skill Description
A person with this skill can describe what is meant by “asynchronous programming” in JavaScript and how it makes JavaScript powerful. They can use asynchronous tools to deal with “deferred work” in their program.


## Output
- **Task:** Create a simple JavaScript program that runs a task asynchronously in the background.
- **Resources:** Use promises (and/or conditionals) as appropriate. 
- **Include:** n/a

### Behaviors

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I want my program to be able to run a function at some point in the future, **Action:** I use callbacks. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need my program to run as quickly as possible for multiple functions, **Action:** I consider how I could use asynchronous programming to do so. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When any part of a function or method is asynchronous, **Action:** I make all parts of it asynchronous. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I am writing code meant to be run asynchronously, **Action:** I consider using `async await` to make the code easier to read. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I want to ensure that my program is never blocking an action that needs to execute, **Action:** I use asynchronous programming as a default. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have two functions listening for the same method, **Action:** I order them carefully, knowing that the one that is registered first will be run first. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I need to call multiple functions sequentially, **Action:** I use promises. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| **Context:** When I have nested callbacks, **Action:** I use promises to simplify and “flatten out” my code. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |

### Beliefs

| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| If I overuse callbacks, I can create an impossible tangle of Callback Hell. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Promises are difficult-- but they are not impossible. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
| Promises and asynchronous programming provide a cleaner way to program in JavaScript. |   [ ]   |   [ ] |
