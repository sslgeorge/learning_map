# Outcome 15 - Security

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow demonstrates a general understanding of how to analyze code to identify and close vulnerabilities.

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Security analysis of a vulnerable program with identified vulnerabilities
2. Version of above program with vulnerabilities closed


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Security vulnerabilities | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Types of attacks/exploits     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Common vulnerabilities with web and mobile applications     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * How to evaluate relative priorities and urgency of different security vulnerabilites    | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * How to close common vulnerabilities with web and mobile applications     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * How to report vulnerabilites in my organization     | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I test programs **Action:** I do so with the mindset of an attacker seeking vulnerabilities to exploit | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I test my programs **Action:** I run security tests for common vulnerabilities | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I identify vulnerabilities in a program I built **Action:** I close the vulnerabilities and test again to ensure that they are gone | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I identify vulnerabilities in a program built by my organization **Action:** I report them to the appropriate stakeholders | [ ] | [ ]  |



----------


## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Being able to identify security vulnerabilities makes me an asset to my organization | [ ] | [ ]  |
| I can build more secure applications by thinking like an attacker when building and testing | [ ] | [ ]  |
| It is my responsibility to protect people who use the things I create | [ ] | [ ]  |
