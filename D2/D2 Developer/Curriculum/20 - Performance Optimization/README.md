# Outcome 20 - Performance Optimization

**Skill Description**
----------
The Fellow understands the importance of application performance and how it impacts the overall goals of the company and the end users of the application. The Fellow can use tools to baseline performance, use their knowledge of systems design and algorithms to improve performance, and clearly convey the results of the performance improvements

**Output**
----------
After attaining this skill, and as a demonstration of it, a person should be able to create the following:

1. Performance monitoring configuration for an existing system
2. System improvements based on monitoring report
3. Proposed correlations between system improvements and benefits to the business


**Objectives**
----------
## **Knowledge**


| Knowledge Unit   |      Studied      | Applied |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| I can describe the following from memory: | | |
| * Performance Optimization | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Tools for measuring/monitoring performance     | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Common performance metrics    | [ ] | [ ]  |
| * Effective ways of conveying the results of performance optimization efforts    | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Behaviors**

| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When deploying an application **Action:** I set up a performance monitoring system with it | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When I get negative performance reports **Action:** I investigate the reports to identify the cause of poor performance | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After identifying causes of poor performance **Action:** I leverage my understanding of systems design and algorithms/data structures to make improvement recommendations (solutions and expected results)  | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** After performance improvement recommendations have been implemented **Action:** I compare the performance metrics to the expected metrics in the recommendations   | [ ] | [ ]  |
| **Context:** When sharing performance improvements **Action:** I include the benefits of those improvements to the business   | [ ] | [ ]  |

## **Beliefs**


| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| If I don't monitor the performance of my applications, I cannot meaningfully improve them | [ ] | [ ]  |
| Application performance is what sets great developers apart from merely competent developers | [ ] | [ ]  |
| People only love applications if they perform well | [ ] | [ ]  |
| The business impact of performance improvements are as important as the system performance improvements | [ ] | [ ]  |
