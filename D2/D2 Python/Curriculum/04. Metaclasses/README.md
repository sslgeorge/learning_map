# Python - Descriptors and Metaclasses


## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to use metaclasses to build APIs and tools for others to use.

## Output: 

**Task:** Using the [FlaskRestful documentation](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), build a minimal Flask-RESTful API replica.

### Behaviors:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:**  When I want to automatically insert a known method into a set of classes, **Action:** I simply code the method in a superclass and have all the classes in question inherit from it. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |

| Descriptors provide fine grained control over attribute access and over how others can use my program.| [ ] | [ ] |
| Metaclasses are primarily intended for building APIs and tools for others to use.| [ ] | [ ] |
