# Python - GUI Programming (with Tkinter)

## Skill Description:

A fellow is able to apply Python to build portable graphical user interfaces, primarily with Python’s standard Tkinter library.

# Output: 

**Task:** Create a GUI application using Tkinter.  All you need to do is perform the following steps: 
* Import the Tkinter module.
* Create the GUI application main window.
* Add one or more of the Tkinter widgets to the GUI application.
* Enter the main event loop to take action against each event triggered by the user.

| What is GUI programming? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What is Tkinter? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to create a GUI using Tkinter? | [ ] | [ ] |
| What are the different types widgets (controls) that Tkinter provides in Python? | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to construct a widget in Tkinter. | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to specify standard attributes such as sizes, colors, dimensions and fonts. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| How to use entry widgets to get input, such as text strings, from the user of an application | [ ] | [ ] |
| How to use specific geometry management methods (pack, grid, and place), to control and organize how widgets are arranged in a window | [ ] | [ ] |


### Behaviours:
| Observable Behavior   |      Practiced      | Observed |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| **Context:** When I construct a widget in tkinter, **Action:** I specify how it should be configured, first, as a parent-widget object, and secondly as a configuration option for the Label. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| **Context:**  When I’ve constructed widget object trees as models of what you want to see on the screen, **Action:** I then ask the tree to display itself by calling mainloop. | [ ] | [ ] |


### Beliefs:
| Embodied Belief   |      Felt      | Demonstrated |
|:-------------|:------------------:|:--------:|
| Tkinter programming concepts translate directly to any other GUI toolkit you choose to utilize. | [ ] | [ ] |
| Tkinter is a standard module in the Python library, shipped with the interpreter. | [ ] | [ ] |
| A Label widget can display either text or an icon or other image. | [ ] | [ ] | 
| The entry widget allows the user to enter a single line of text. | [ ] | [ ] |
| The parent-widget argument is the hook used to build up complex GUIs as widget trees.  | [ ] | [ ] |
| Tkinter works on a “what-you-build-is-what-you-get” principle. | [ ] | [ ] |
| If you don’t pass any arguments to pack , you get default packing, which attaches the widget to the top side of its container. | [ ] | [ ] |
